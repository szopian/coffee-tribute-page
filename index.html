            <h2>The day of coffee was born..</h2>
            <p>The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee</p>
            <p>after he noticed that after eating the berries from a</p> <p>certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they</p> <p>did not want to sleep at night. ... As word moved east and</p> <p>coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey</p> <p>which would bring these beans across the globe.</p>
